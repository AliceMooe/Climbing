            <p>  It's the kind of unique back-to-nature experience that goes with camping! Book a spot at one of these wild swimming campsites and you'll find a cool lake,
                 river or maybe even waterfall close by where you can take the perfect dip. 
            There are plenty of reasons why we reckon a wild swim beats a few lengths in the municipal pool. The scenery is usually more picturesque 
            for starters! The natural wallpaper will vary depending on where you’ve chosen to take the plunge. But whether it’s beach and horizon, 
            trees and vegetation or rocks and mountains, it’s probably nicer than the walls, ceiling and deep-end warnings of your local pool. Secondly, are the health benefits. 
            Any swimming is exercise, of course, but cold-water swimming is thought to be especially good for you – and let’s face it, if you’re swimming in the UK, it’s likely to be a bit nippy.

            <p> One of the joys of wild camping is the chance to sleep under the stars in beautiful
                 rural locations.Wild camping is a peaceful activity which offers the chance to 
                 sleep immersed in nature. After a long day of walking on a long-distance trail,
                  falling asleep to the sound of a hooting owl in the distance or snuffling badger 
                  is a life-affirming experience and the perfect tonic to the stresses of modern 
                  life.Tempting though the solitude of the wilderness may be, wild camping can be 
                  daunting for first-timers,
                 which is why our handy guide explains how to wild camp legally and safely.
                 The general rule for wild camping is to check whether you can legally camp - or get permission and it is vital to leave no trace.
                Before heading to the wilderness to wild camp, it's important to check the rules in your region. The majority of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, campers have no legal rights so check before you camp or get the landowner's permission. Some sites in Scotland, including Loch Lomond now require campers to get a permit so do your research before you go.
                It is important to do your research before you set off on a wild camping trip (which is where this guide comes in). Plan your walking routes carefully, check the weather conditions, terrain and ensure you've got all the gear you need to hike and camp safely.</p>
